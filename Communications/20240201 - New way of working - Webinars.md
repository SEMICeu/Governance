# New way of working - Webinars
## Community interaction
We have noticed that our webinars frequently run over the allocated time, resulting in some topics not being fully addressed. Our aim is to maximise the value derived from these webinars. For this to be achieved, we need to improve our handling of community feedback. We propose to highlight these issues on GitHub, enabling us to prepare a proposal that is more aligned with the community's expectations, as discussions would have been held prior. Labels will be employed to streamline this process, in particular the label 'next-webinar'. Furthermore, a summary of resolved issues will be presented to the community during the webinars.

More information on labeling can be found under [Issue Handling](https://github.com/SEMICeu/Policies-Governance-Maintenance-Communication/blob/main/Governance/Issue%20Handling.md).
